I am no longer working on this project. Version 1.0.2 to 1.0.4 are all broken, version 1.0.1 works fine if you figure out how to use it since I haven't released any documentation. Feel free to use this package, if you do decide to use my package and run into trouble open an issue on GitHub or send me an email ( ayrton.taede@gmail.com ).
